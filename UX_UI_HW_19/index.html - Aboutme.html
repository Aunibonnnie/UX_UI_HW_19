                    <p>is a non-profit organization in Marquette, Michigan. 
                        The Women’s Center organizes shelters and other resources for those escaping or recovering from an abusive situation. 
                        They service all of the local area regardless of age, sexuality, or gender</p>
                       
                        <h2>Project Proposel</h2>
        <p>We believe improving the women’s center website for those needing to escape or heal from an abusive relationship 
            will achieve a safer, more discreet, and overall better experience to recreate a normal life</p>
                    
                        <h2>The Problem</h2>
                        <p>The Women’s center website was designed to provide those involved in abusive situations with safe resources, support, and aftercare. 
                        We have observed that the website has no navigation hierarchy which could cause confusion when looking for fast resources on a time limit. 
                        How might we improve the center’s website so clients can quickly and discreetly access resources? </p>
                        <h2>The Solution</h2>
                        Based off of our user interactive testing for The Women’s Center website, we were able to create a better hierarchy and a user friendly website for the target audience.    
Redesign navigation hierarchy
Apply a calming color scheme
Simplify the layout of the website for better usability 
Update functions
